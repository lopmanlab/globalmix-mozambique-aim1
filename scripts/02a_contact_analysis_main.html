<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Background</h1>
<p>This is a summary of results from analysis of GlobalMix data collected in Mozambique. The project had two aims: 1. quantify social contact patterns among individuals data using paper diaries 2. quantify social contact patter within households using paper diaries and wearable proximity sensors</p>
<p>This analysis focuses on aim 1 only. Data were collected from Manhica (rural site) and Polana Canhico (urban site) between April 2020 and April 2021. Individuals were identified from the health and demographic surveillance system available in each site. We aimed to recruit 63 individuals from each of 10 age groups (&lt;6 months, 6-11 months, 1-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14, 15-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-59 and 60+ years).</p>

<p>The figures below presents a summary the characteristics of the participants in the rural and urban site. A total of 1449 individuals participated in the study, with 730 and 719 participants recruited from the rural and urban sites, respectively. In some age groups (&lt;5 yrs and 40-59 yrs) we recruited more than the target. By site, there was no major difference in number of participants recruited by age, sex, and school enrollment status.</p>

<p>We observe no difference in the median (IQR) number of contacts reported on day 1 compared to day 2.</p>
<p>Additional analysis can include: 1. mean number of contacts over both days 2. mean number of contacts of unique contacts only over both days 3. mean number of unique contacts reported on both day 1 and 2</p>
